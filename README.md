# Portfolio

## Description
This project creates a website to showcase my work and give my contact details. I plan to continuously iterate on this work as I develop more skills. Itâ€™s currently only using HTML and CSS.

## Usage
https://cleffy.github.io/Portfolio/  
The site is designed for a maximum width of 1280px to maintain the ratio of elements on the page. When hovering over links there is a dashed line, when hovering over a project, the image increases in size and the background changes color.

When the site's width is less than 768px it goes into a single column format.
